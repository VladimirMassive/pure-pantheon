        title: "Merry Saturnalia!",
        content: 'I used to think it was impossible to have too much aggression in your system but these last three weeks might have proven otherwise. My fury and adrenaline have been through the fucking roof and I can’t even warmup without my gym’s shitty barbells snapping in half. Gym manager told me to stop strapping treadmills to either side but I told him to shut the fuck up if he wanted to keep his teeth attached to his gum line. I’m here to make progress not push up some baby weight! He kept his bitch mouth shut after that but I still got dirty looks from him every time I walked in, and I officially lost my temper when I got out from the locker room and saw him brooding in the corner. Something had to be done! “Get over here!” I roared. He was wary at first but I assured him that I only wanted advice on how to use the smith machine. LMAO. “Uh s-sure…” When he bent down to show off how the locking mechanism worked I picked up the jagged end of one of the barbells I had snapped, and plunged it into his back. “OH GOD!” he squeeled. “Buy some better equipment phaggot! Don’t let this happen again! FUUUUUARKKKK!” I stomped on his face for good measure then left the building to unleash my fury on my girlfriend’s anus. "It’s time to annihilate from behind!” I roared as I stormed into my apartment, accidentally ripping the front door off its hinges. I waited for her to get ready, and noticed an envelope on the counter-top with a symbol of two snakes wrapped around a winged pole stamped on the front. I opened it in curiosity and felt my heart race as I read the letter it contained. “Oh shit!” I cried, calling up Igor to get to my place immediately. I lost all interest in anything else and ordered my girlfriend out when she came in the room dressed in her panties. “What’s going on?” “OUT!” I threw her ass over the balcony and tossed her clothes down after her for good measure. When Igor showed up I told him to follow me out front where, sure enough, a taxi was standing by waiting for us, just like the letter had said. I told the driver to make a detour to pick up Marco and soon enough we were all in the backseat ready to go. “Alright brahs, you ready for some aesthetic Saturnalia festivities?” “What the fuck is Saturnalia? Where we going?” “Why do you think I’ve been so hyper-active these past few weeks? Saturnalia brah, this letter says it makes Titans and gods like me fucking nuts. You aware? Get ready to rage out on Olympus cause I’ve been invited, and you two are coming with!” Marco didn’t need any more information than that and he started going on about all the hot nymph pussy he was going to berry himself into. Igor on the other hand was sporting his usual enraged scowl but I could tell that he too was excited. “Alright boys,” the driver smiled after what only seemed like a couple seconds, “we’re here.” I looked outside in surprise and was shocked to see that we were high up on what could only be Mt. Olympus itself. I jumped out, tore off my shirt, popped my pecs, and started muzzing out to the aesthetic harp music blasting through the air overhead. I looked around to see who was mirin, but to my dismay didn’t see even one familiar face. I’ve had my fair share of encounters with the gods before, so I’m more than familiar with how they look. None of them were there. I started talking with some of the other guests and was horrified to discover that they were all “gods” over lame shit like notebook paper. Apparently, the main show was going on at the peak of the mountain and these losers weren’t invited! We ran back to the taxi and ordered the driver to take us up there at once. He was a bit reluctant at first and said we weren’t allowed, but I broke his nose and told him to change his tune pronto. He cried and took us up and we laughed as Igor proceeded to rip him out through the windshield and throw his bitch ass over the side of the mountain. We walked up to the gate surrounding the palace and saw four cardio bunnies, each with a different hair color, standing guard. “Who are you three plebs who come upon the palace of Olympus? What business do you have here?” the blonde one spoke. “My business is to get inside. Step aside cupcake.” “You dare to speak to the Horai in such a way? We are the guardians of Olympus; away with you!” Marco could sense I was about to knock them out and took matters into his own hands. He stripped naked and started waving his cawk around, mesmerizing them all and allowing us to slip through undetected while they began giggling like schoolgirls. I was half tempted to join in on the fun, but I had something far more tantalizing in mind. We walked inside, shirtless, and immediately saw an orgy of immortal flesh pressed up against each other in divine ecstasy. All manners of gods and deities greeted my eyes, but there was only one who I was interested in finding. Zeus. I scanned the crowd until I spotted him talking with some beta no-names. “Hey!” I yelled, grabbing his shoulder and spinning him around. “What the FUCK?!” He was surprised and unhappy to see me and he called for Hermes to come over, demanding to know why I had been invited. “What?” Hermes protested. “He IS a demi-titan after all…” In his hand was a staff that bore a perfect likeness to the symbol I had seen on the envelope. “Exactly.” I smiled, “I belong here.” “I don’t give a shit who you are! You are NOT a part of the godly pantheon! You’re a fucking half breed. Now go back down the mountain with the other losers.” “Fuck those sadkunts! I deserve my own worshippers!” This is what I had come for. The possibility of becoming a major god made my heart race and I yearned to have my own followers sacrifice virgins in my name. “You will NEVER become a real god! Never!” “Do you really want a repeat of the last time we met?” Igor pulled out his extension cord and whipped the air with a loud crack. Zeus started gulping and nervously called Apollo over to help him out. Apollo was once my slave for a few weeks after he lost a bet, and he looked at me angrily as they began whispering between one another. After thirty seconds of excited conversation they both smiled and turned to me. “Very well.” Zeus said. “We will give you the opportunity to prove your worth and earn a place on the pantheon.” “Great. When do we start?” “Whenever Apollo feels like. He’ll be able to pop in to visit you whenever he wishes and command you as he sees fit. You’re getting the Herculean treatment so get ready. Now begone from my sight.” Apollo sneered and waved me goodbye. I exited the gates and saw Marco banging the Summer goddess while the other ones sucked his nuts. I smiled. If all things went right I would soon have Zeus and all the other doubters doing the same to me. No homo.'

        content: "So I strolled into the gym the other day with Igor and Marco by my side, ready to blast into a peak pec workout like usual, when I noticed a distinct lack of gazes upon me. Usually when I walk into the gym people take fucking notice but today everybody’s attention was fixed upon none other than Lance Armstrong doing half squats in the curl rack! Needless to say, my pride couldn’t take playing second fiddle to a steroid abusing skinny phaggot, and I ran headfirst into the crowd of awestruck retards watching him, angrily throwing people out of my way. “The fuck you doing here brah?! THE FUCK YOU DOING HERE?!” I yelled. I pointed at Igor who flexed his biceps behind me. “This is the only cycling you’re going to find here! You aware brah? You Tour de France brah?” He put his hands up and backed away uneasily. “L-Look guys I-I’m just in town to promote my brand Livestrong…” Livestrong huh? Well let’s see if you can walk the walk as well as you talk the talk!” I picked him up and threw him back into the squat rack and Igor slammed the bar onto his shoulders. “W-What are you guys doing? There’s n-no need for -” “SHUT THE FUCK UP!” I barked at Igor to load 315 onto the bar. “Ten reps right now!” He went down and attempted to come back up at the half way point but I yelled at him to put his ass to the grass, then picked up a barbell and smashed it into his back. “Oh god… Stop it!” he screamed as he started teetering back and forth. “Resistance training brah you gotta ‘live strong’! 9 more reps!” He started crying as Igor and I began viciously beating him with the gym equipment, but his tears only made us hit harder. One of the trainers tried to intervene and stop us but Marco grabbed him and slammed his face through the mirrors. “One more, feel the burn!” I roared as he struggled up on his final rep. Just as it looked like he had finally gotten it under control and was going to lock it out, Igor slammed a 50 pound dumbbell onto the top of his skull, causing him to fold over and drop the weight on his neck as he collapsed. “Are you serious?” I spat in disgust, “That’s fucking nothing, get up!” Despite my encouragements however, he remained motionless and I had Igor throw him out through the emergency exit, before proceeding to liberate all the products he had brought with him. Anyway, I soon forgot about our little altercation, until only yesterday while I was in my office jerking off to my previous days training footage. Just as I was about to bust a nut I got word that he was suing me! Apparently, our little training session had left him severely injured, both mentally and physically, and now he wanted compensation. The letter he sent said that he’d drop the case if I gave him back the money I got from selling his stuff, but I refused and told him to get ready for some court action. I got his shit fair and square; it’s not my fault he can’t live up to his claim of “living strong”. This is outrageous!"
